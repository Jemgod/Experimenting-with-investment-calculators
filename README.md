**THIS IS JUST A FUN TEST AND NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE**

This little program I have made is to require an input from the user to run a calculation to discover an investments appreciation.

You can use this to calculate. 
- Bond appreciation w/ coupons.
- Share appreciation w/ dividends.

I may add a basic interest calculating module for compounding at a later date... but we will see! 
I hope you enjoy and please do not use this as real advise for investing!!!
